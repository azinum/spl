- file inclusion guards
- differentiate between signed and unsigned comparison operators for where it is nessesary (e.g. cmovl vs. cmovb for signed and unsigned values respectively)
- remove the ability, by ways of parsing, to define functions in functions (causes undefined behaviour, crashes)
- typed assignment operator
- do more work on type casting
- make sure there is room for a null terminator in symbol names
- add ability to use escaped and unescaped `raw` strings
- function inlining
- compile time evaluation of `trival` functions
- fix parsing bug where `;` is not detected after binary operation
- fix parsing bug where single `}` are not detected
